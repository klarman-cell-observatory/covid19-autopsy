All gene programs, enhancer-gene linking annotations, supplementary data files and highresolution figures are available online at https://data.broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/LDSCORE/Jagadeesh_Dey_sclinker. 

This work used summary statistics from the COVID Host Genetics initiative. 

This work uses the S-LDSC software (https://github.com/bulik/ldsc) as well as MAGMA v1.08 for post-hoc
analysis (https://ctg.cncr.nl/software/magma). Code for constructing cell type, disease progression
and cellular process gene programs from scRNA-seq data and performing the healthy and disease
shared NMF can be found at https://github.com/karthikj89/scgenetics. Code for processing gene
programs and combining with enhancer-gene links can be found at
https://github.com/kkdey/GSSG.
